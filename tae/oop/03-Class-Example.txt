You can include an access modifier for fields and methods (also called members) of a class. Access modifiers are keywords used to specify the accessibility of a member.
A member that has been defined public can be accessed from outside the class, as long as it's anywhere within the scope of the class object.

If no access modifier is defined, the member is private by default.

The new operator instantiates an object and returns a reference to its location.
